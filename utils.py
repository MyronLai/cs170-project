    Since there is always unique path between nodes in a tree, each edge in the
    tree is used in all of the paths from the connected component on one side
    of the tree to the other. So each edge contributes to the total pairwise cost
    in the following way: if the size of the connected components that are
    created from removing an edge e are A and B, then the total pairwise distance
    cost for an edge is 2 * A * B * w(e) = (# of paths that use that edge) * w(e).
    We multiply by two to consider both directions that paths can take on an
    undirected edge.
    Since each edge connects a subtree to the rest of a tree, we can run DFS
    to compute the sizes of all of the subtrees, and iterate through all the edges
    and sum the pairwise distance costs for each edge and divide by the total
    number of pairs.
    This is very similar to Q7 on MT1.
